# Bistro

Sample app using Swift

Using: 
 - Google Firebase / Auth
 - CDYelpApiClient
 - PaperOnboarding (Not yet added)
 
Purpose: 

To find a random restaurant near you. The found restaurant goes automatically to your Story viewcontroller where you can like the restaurant.

Will work on this app later. Looks like yelp and I want to work on something unique.
